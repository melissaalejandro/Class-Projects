### Project Pizza

This project seeks to understand why a local restaurant has a one-star review.

#### Steps

Data exploration: an overview of ratings, emotion categories (positive/negative), frequently used words graph, word clouds of most frequently used words, distribution of ratings, sentiment analysis.

#### Findings

**Why does this restaurant have low ratings?**

Most customers are unhappy with their experience because their food has either arrived cold or burnt. 
Customer service is subpar, the long wait times, and customers receive incorrect orders
How they feel about the restaurant matches up with the average sentiment

**Recommended Improvements:**

- Retrain existing staff on customer service or rehire completely new staff

- Hire more staff. Many times, food arrived hours after placing an order. It would be beneficial to hire more drivers to get food to customers more quickly

- Retrain staff on how to operate machinery correctly so that food is not overcooked 

- Invest in a pizza box warmer so that food does not arrive cold

**Positive Factors**
The food is excellent when it is cooked and warm!
