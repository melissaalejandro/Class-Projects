## Project Pizza

This project seeks to understand why a local restaurant has a one-star rating by using text and sentiment analysis.

**Data exploration** 

An overview of ratings, which includes using a bell curve to visualize the distribution of ratings

**Text Analysis**

Categorize emotions (positive/negative), graph the most frequently used words, and create word clouds.


**Sentiment Analysis**

Tested customer sentiment using five packages: Syuzhet, Bing, AFINN, NRC, and Sentimentr. 


## Mass Shootings

Analysis that utilizes the OLS and Poisson regressions to determine whether more gun laws lead to more mass shootings


## Testing the Philip's Curve Theory using time-series analysis

We test the Phillips Curve Theory using time series data to examine the short and long-run relationship between the inflation and unemployment rates.

## Predicting a Diabetic Diagnosis

Using the Pima Indian Diabetes data set from the Kaggle website, we built a supervised model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes with 83% accuracy. We used Logistic Regression, PLSDA Regression, SVM Radial, and Random Forest to accomplish this.
