## app.r

The app was designed to be an unemployment rate comparison tool. It allows you to view the unemployment rate for all states before and after covid-19.


## Project Pizza

This project seeks to understand why a local restaurant has a one-star review by using text and sentiment analysis.

**Data exploration:** an overview of ratings, which includes using a bell curve to visualize the distribution of ratings

**Text Analysis**

We used emotion categories (positive/negative), a frequently used words graph, and word clouds.


**Sentiment Analysis**

Tested customer sentiment using five packages: Syuzhet, Bing, AFINN, NRC, and Sentimentr. 

**Findings**

Most customers are unhappy with their experience because their food has either arrived cold or burnt. 
Customer service is subpar, the long wait times, and customers receive incorrect orders
How they feel about the restaurant matches up with the average sentiment

**Recommended Improvements:**

- Retrain existing staff on customer service or rehire completely new staff

- Hire more staff. Many times, food arrived hours after placing an order. It would be beneficial to hire more drivers to get food to customers more quickly

- Retrain staff on how to operate machinery correctly so that food is not overcooked 

- Invest in a pizza box warmer so that food does not arrive cold

**Positive Factors:**
The food is excellent when it is cooked and warm!


## Mass Shootings

Analysis that utilizes the OLS and Poisson regressions to determine whether more gun laws lead to more mass shootings

## Testing the Philip's Curve using time-series analysis

 The purpose of this project was to test the relationship between unemployment and inflation (Philip's curve theory), which states that there is an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. The Philip's curve describes how lower unemployment means that people spend more. When people spend more, pressure is placed on prices to rise, consequently leading to inflation. The opposite is also true: inflation will be lower during times of high unemployment due to reduced spending. We test the Phillips Curve theory using time series data to examine the short and long-run relationship between inflation and unemployment.

Overall, the data is consistent with the notion that inflation and unemployment are inversely related. One exciting aspect of this analysis was learning that inflation causes unemployment, but not the other way around. From the Phillips Curve theory, we also expected unemployment to affect inflation.
