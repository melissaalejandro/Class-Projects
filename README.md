**Data exploration** 

An overview of ratings, which includes using a bell curve to visualize the distribution of ratings

We test the Phillips Curve Theory using time series data to examine the short and long-run relationship between the inflation and unemployment rates.

## Predicting a Diabetic Diagnosis

Using the Pima Indian Diabetes data set from the Kaggle website, we built a supervised model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes with 83% accuracy. We used Logistic Regression, PLSDA Regression, SVM Radial, and Random Forest to accomplish this.
