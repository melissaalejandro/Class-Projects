## Project Pizza

This project seeks to understand why a local restaurant has a one-star rating by using text and sentiment analysis.

**Data exploration:** an overview of ratings, which includes using a bell curve to visualize the distribution of ratings

**Text Analysis**

Categorize emotions (positive/negative), graph the most frequently used words, and create word clouds.


**Sentiment Analysis**

Tested customer sentiment using five packages: Syuzhet, Bing, AFINN, NRC, and Sentimentr. 


## Mass Shootings

Analysis that utilizes the OLS and Poisson regressions to determine whether more gun laws lead to more mass shootings

## Testing the Philip's Curve using time-series analysis

The purpose of this project was to test the Philip's Curve Theory, which states that there is an inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation rate. The theory describes how lower unemployment means that people spend more. When people spend more, pressure is placed on prices to rise, consequently leading to inflation. The opposite is also true: inflation will be lower during times of high unemployment due to reduced spending. We test the Phillips Curve theory using time series data to examine the short and long-run relationship between the inflation and unemployment rates.
