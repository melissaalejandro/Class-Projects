"7/18/2022","3 star ","I just got my order which was somewhat wrong and gave me what I didn't order. Never told me I couldn't get all my order here and o will never order from here again!! I'm Italian from the north end of Boston and the food is ok but come on give me what I ordered the food is ok but not true Italian I'm from Sicily originally  born and raised in Boston north end little Italy my roots are Sicilian if this is Italian in San Antonio then your are very sad!!"
"11/27/2022","1 star ","So I ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Let's start there.  The meat was good!   However, the picture you saw does over-justice.   The picture versus what you get are completely opposite.  The meal I got barely had a sliver of meat which tasted great but I spent 25 with tip for this which is absolutely horrible.  I'm done with ordering thru Uber eats and these fake news restaurant wannabes."
"12/1/2021","1 star ","I am really disappointed with my food. First my order took 1hr and 45 minutes rather than the 45 minutes to an hour like I was told. When I got my food the Chicken Parmasan was burnt and so were the garlic breads.  My Philly cheese steak was meaty but hardly any cheese in it and it was dry. I also ordered a Chicken Alfredo and that was about the only thing that was cooked to order.  Overall, I won't do another delivery from this place and I should have known better since they were soliciting their flyers at the hotel I was staying. The total was $43.07 for all three items and gave the guy $50.  What a complete waste. I called to make a complaint but they had already closed for the evening.I finally went on yelp and shooting myself in the foot for not reading the reviews b4 placing an order. It makes me wonder how a place like this is still able to stay open."
"9/9/2022","1 star ","This was horrific! I ordered the Pizza and pasta combo. They did give me what I ordered.I told them they gave me the wrong one and they started yelling and told me I already paid to I have to deal with it. I threw up and found out later I have food poisoning. I tried to sue but they told me I was being over dramatic."
"8/21/2022","1 star ","My roommate has been waiting for his pizza for over two hours.  He has tried calling them and was met with a total bitch who berated him for daring to ask how long his pizza would be.  I have been sitting outside with him for over an hour and called and asked on his behalf when the pizza would be done and the cunt answering the phone's response was, ""He keeps calling and I told Him that the driver had three orders.""  Guess what, three fucking deliveries do not take two+ hours. The woman manning the phones is incapable of being personable, which is sorry, considering that you can get a 16 year old with a better personality to deal with something so easy.I cannot believe this place is still in business."
"3/22/2022","1 star ","Absolute garbage. The food I received was so bad that it couldn't have been a mistake, it had to be a prank. I ordered a calzone that came with no meat, two pieces of spinach, no cheese, just a literal cup of garlic in a tiny calzone. My house reeks of garlic right now. We ordered three calzones and a salad. One of the other calzones was totally wrong, every ingredient. The other had chicken that tasted like it was taken out of the freezer and put in a microwave for two minutes. Nothing else arrived, no salad, no sauce, nothing. Never again."
"1/16/2022","5 star ","So they had this little menu slipped under our hotel contessa room and I've been trying to find it on Yelp the past several days I just couldn't remember the name but this is definitely it I remember the menu! And I'm blown away there's so many 1 star reviews. Obviously I believe it because I see the pictures but I have to give an honest review the pizza was amazing! We got pepperoni in one and pepperoni and mushroom in another, and a Pepsi. Delivery took 45-50 minutes but it was also 1AM. The guy who delivered was very nice and I only wish I had taken a picture of the pizza it was honestly really good ‍"
"11/16/2021","1 star ","There's a reason this place has one star. Y'all won't believe this lol. We ordered a pick-up order, they said it would be an hour+. We arrive there, and the guy working says the website had canceled our order, then asked if we wanted to REORDER AND PURCHASE AGAIN. Never was notified of a cancellation, a refund, nothing. I asked for proof on his end that said it was canceled, and he said it didn't say cancelation, that ""the orders just disappear."" We called customer service, and they informed us that they never canceled our order, and on their end it says our order was ready at the restaurant! So customer service calls the restaurant and asks wtf they are doing because our order was NOT cancelled, and guess what he told them??? ""We are having technical difficulties."" So two stories are happening, the guy at the restaurant is trying to scam us out of our money, and it was a hot mess. Anyways. This was stupid. Please don't go here."
"5/23/2022","5 star ","racist and rude staff dirty building no one's uses gloves or cleans restaurant customer service is absolutely trash and you would be lucky if people like this didnt spit In  your food and over charge your card just for fun updated to 5 stars because I don't want to hate you guys for ever. But I feel better knowing that no amount if 5 stars will help your rating but sad that your still in business and doing it badly"

"11/20/2021","1 star ","We are from out of town so we went with the flyer in our hotel room. Bad idea. Should have read the reviews first. 1. Took 2 hours for order. Was told would only be less than 1 1/2 hour. 2. Called at 1 1/2 hour and was told order was just coming out. 3. 30 min later pizza arrived and it, wings, cheese bread were all cold. Wrong salad dressing. No utensils, napkins, etc. Told hotel we did not recommend this place. Here is another 1 star rating to go along with the rest."
"6/1/2022","1 star ","Seriously. Just read the reviews. This is a scam business. Watch out on DoorDash, too. They go by Mothership Pizza on there but it's the same place. Save your money."
"8/31/2022","1 star ","This place is disgusting ... no idea how there still in business. The workers touch there phones and resume to touch food . The building itself is disgusting ."
"3/22/2022","1 star ","Is ZERO stars possible? This business is evidently trying to run some scam ghost kitchen called brooklyn calzones. The lining paper in the boxes says 24th st pizzera. It's a scam. They don't pay attention to you order and just throw together whatever they want, leave out any sides, and they DEFINITELY don't  include any marinara with the calzones, as the menu promises. AVOID THIS PLACE. Check out the photo- rhe Williamsburg calzone had very little spinach and cheese but so much garlic that it was DISGUSTING."
"3/2/2022","1 star ","This place has staff that  calls you, ""stupid mother fr""! .... not just once, but calls you back and says it again. The Supposed Assistant  Manager, knowing the order was well over an hour late, provided non-sensical excuses why it was late. He used the world famous... the driver was in an accident excuse.Pizza was cold and tasted terrible.Wings tasted good and were at temp.Milk was very warm.Deserts were good.Customer service was the worst I have had in all my 50 years on this earth.Avoid this place , my recommendation!If I owned this place, these two people would not work there anymore."
"1/4/2022","5 star ","I don't know why I see so many bad reviews. I ordered and it was super late, I have never heard of them before but the food was great. We got the pasta pizza bundle, I was in a hurry and hungry. They made sure to follow instructions and they were excellent."
"3/29/2022","1 star ","So very upset. First time I ordered they food was magnificent. Tonight I was very disappointed. I ordered through door dash. I ordered 2 chicken Alfredo and a 8 piece buffalo wings. Wings were ok but the dipping sauce was missing. The part that upset me the most was that BOTH bowls of pasta was only plain dry pasta. No sauce, and no chicken. I called the restaurant and she said that the order was placed based on what the door dash person said. But why would anyone order plain pasta. Just served it with no questions asked. Didn't the cost look weird. Is that what you charge for plain pasta? No worries. Never ordering from there again through door dash. I might go in but I doubt it."
"9/5/2020","1 star ","I didn't even get my food to know it was a disappointing. Placed my order at 7:30...never showed. Called at 8:53 said it would be here in 5 mins. Watched the delivery guy come to the hotel we are staying out (that they advertise in) and leave. Called them again at 9:11 was put on hold for 10 mins to then be hung up on. Called back and said I want to cancel my order. Guy said he'll be here in one minute, said no he can take it back. I don't want it now and asked for a refund. He said okay and that was it. No I'm sorry for the delay, nothing. Never even said we are super busy and down a cook or driver or something. Come on here to find out this place sucks. Glad I didn't eat it cause I probably would've ended up sick afterwords!Cancelled calls are because their phone had a busy tone."
"9/22/2021","1 star ","This place is trash on all levels. The only reason they're in business is because they're the only pizza spot open til 3 am. They have multiple kids 7 and under in the shop all night eating cheese and walking around bare foot. Their mom is usually the only employee and she's always yelling and cussing at them. This place should be investigated and shut down."
"6/4/2022","1 star ","Absolutely awful! Also goes by the name Freaking good pizza. This name could've be farther from the truth. The so called hot wings are flavorless and tossed in watered down Tabasco sauce and oil not even a hot wing sauce they are dry and chewy. Pizza was freaking disgusting. Pizza was burnt and the taste was terrible. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! Save your money. You have been warned!"
"6/28/2022","1 star ","I don't know what is wrong with the female who runs this business but she's a real bitch who hates her job and her life. Her attitude needs an adjustment, one of these days she gone get a stank ass attitude with the wrong one and get her ass beat. Don't order from this shitty place, she for damn sure is making your food with all the hate in her heart, you don't want to ingest that energy."
"11/14/2021","1 star ","How the do you get fried pickles confused with mozzarella sticks you donkey best at that I called and bob answers I tell him my complaints he says he will send driver and was about to hang up I said hold on how are you gonna send driver I didn't even give you my address not gonna recommended I work at hotel which this place gives give us flyers to give to guest I'm gonna throw those flyers away in trash every guest that ask about this place I will tell them to stay away"
"8/15/2022","1 star ","now i never EVER write reviews but this one has got to be the one restaurant that truly lives up to what people base them off of.i ordered through uber eats (it was late night and i was hungry) and so in return, im waiting 2 hours for some wings to arrive, i try checking to see if there's a tracking to know what my order is at, but there's none. it's only telling me to call the merchant, which is this hell hole of a restaurant, i called and whoever answered was in other words bitchy. i asked on the status of my order and she just tells me to talk to uber, i tell her that i can't bc it's only showing to call the restaurant, she's repeating herself like if i'm fucking stupid, and i repeat myself that there's no tracking and i have to call their restaurant in order to check the status, as i was telling her, she hung up. now i understand if a customer is rude to just hang up but i never cussed, i was just simply trying to get her to understand that THERE WAS NO TRACKING FOR MY ORDER; thankfully i contacted uber eats and just cancelled my order bc it took too fucking long, only for them to close the restaurant just probably wants to take your money, wish i can rate this negative stars bc what the fuck was this shit lmao"
"5/7/2022","1 star ","Don't even bother ordering. They are extremely rude and don't give a flying fuck about your order"
"12/7/2020","1 star ","I ordered ONE calzone through Grub Hub. 1.5 hrs later I still did not have my order. I called the restaurant to see what was up & the lady had attitude from the get go before saying ""oh what the hell, you shoulda had that by now"". How professional, anyways thats it... thats all she said. I said Cancel my order and give me my refund and she said she cant. Not once did she apologize for the delay or the inconvenience. No customer service at all. COMPLETE TRASH.After finally cancelling through GrubHub I went through some yelp reviews and Grub Hub reviews. I've consolidated some of the best reviews/pics and will be attaching them here for your benefit,Enjoy Please, please, please never order from here. No one should ever have to go through this."
"12/25/2020","1 star ","Extremely rude, lied to me about my order going to a ""different store"" that I called and they had no idea what I was talking about.  I called 24th street back, and they hung up on me, and when I called back again they would not answer.  My husband had to call and was told our food would be hours late with no apology.  Then hung up on again.How are they still in business?  Take your business elsewhere!!"
"9/6/2020","1 star ","I can't stand a company that tresspasses onto hotel propertly, to slide their advertising for a sub par product, no, for a crappy product under all the doors in the hotel.    This stuff is so bad, that ordering Dominos is a much better option (((shudder)))"
"4/16/2021","1 star ","If i could give this place negative stars i would. Ordered pizza and wing combo, got pink wings and Marinara sauce on a plate with the toppings on the side. like what?! what a joke of a restaurant, do not give this place any more money. I would rather eat roaches and grass than pay for another pizza and wings from this place. what a JOKE"
"12/4/2021","1 star ","Actually not even that. I had the worst experience with any pizza place here. Zero professionalism. As well as no responsibility over pizza being delivered. spent over $80 and delivery driver drove buy and did not deliver the pizza. Wouldn't get money back or anything"
"11/27/2021","1 star ","Everything everyone has said is true .. horrible place do not order. Oqner doesn't care either"
"11/21/2021","1 star ","Horrible. Ordered a pizza for delivery to Hilton at 9PM. Delivery driver called that he dropped off at front desk at 10PM. Front desk never received anything. He called back said he left at wrong hotel but pizza was already cold would ask manager for a new one. Called me back 30 mins later and said manager said to bad and wouldn't make me one. I called manager and they acted they didn't know what we were talking about. Delivery driver called me back and said that they do this about 4-6 times a day to people. Horrible place. Avoid it at all cost!!! It's 1130 PM and kids had to fall asleep hungry. Put manager and driver on 3 way call and then driver changed his story and said he did deliver. Then manager with kids yelling in the background said it was between us and she couldn't do anything. All they do is scam people. Save yourself a headache and AVOID this trash place."
"11/28/2021","1 star ","Pizza was cold and raw the dough was burn in the bottom and raw very disappointing for the price and for the waiting time, cheese sticks were soggy and dipping sauce seems that it was left out the fridge overnight it was rotten very disappointed of this place, i do not recommend"
"3/21/2021","1 star ","Ordered a 10 inch pizza to be delivered to my room at the Gunter hotel. Pepperoni ,green peppers ,mushrooms and feta and a orange soda. Simple enough. They said OK...be their in a half hour since they are right down the street. I was Hungary too. A hour and 15 later a knock at the door! Nice its here I say. Delivery guy hands the pizza over and my soda in a brown bag. But no delivery warming thing for the pizza? He says 28.00 an dI think dam that's a lot for a 10 inch pizza and a soda!! I pay and he leaves. I learn from my mistakes and that wont happen again. I open pizza box to reveal a completely wrong pizza. One with sausage and onions!!! My wife hates BOTH.Wait it gets worse.I pull the soda out of the bag and lo and behold its a OJ!!These dummies' cant even get that right.So bad I didn't even call back to complain. I'm sure they hear it ALL THE TIME anyway.So not only was I out 30 bucks the order was totally messed up and wife and I went to bed Hungary.Did I mention it was cold too!!!"
"8/5/2021","1 star ","Worst pizza I have ever eaten. I also ordered fried mushrooms and instead got little fried burnt mushrooms that resembled buck shot. Pizza was stuck to the cardboard pizza box. Very bad and should be shut down."
"8/9/2021","1 star ","Customer Service was horrendous I placed an order for A gyro from menu and was then later told they don't serve that item when I tried to order something different the self proclaimed manager didn't understand she didn't know the menu was completely rude and unhelpful and hung up on me. Will never order from this dump again."
"7/18/2021","1 star ","if i could give this place 0 stars i would. i tried to order from here through the phone & the female that answered was giving me nothing but attitude. i asked her about bundles & to break down the prices & she just didn't give af. i called a second time hoping someone else would speak & the same girl answered. i asked her once more for a price breakdown on my order & she was just throwing constant attitude. we tried calling over & over & they would pick up & hang up when we would start talking. we called one more time to see if our order was on the way (it had been an hour) & she just had so much disrespect. i asked if it was still in the process of making & she just ignored me. i gave up with trying to talk to these people & asked to cancel my order & she cussed me out & hung up. worst place to order from, save your money."
"7/17/2021","1 star ","In front out of down.  Called to place an order and girl that answered phone told me it would be a 2 hour delivery wait I said ok. She then said call back in 2 hours then hung up on me.  When I called back to speak to manager she then told me they went home. Was Rude as ever. Will NEVER Recommend  to anyone. If u don't want business u shouldn't distribute ur flyers at hotels. Pls don't order from these idiots. Sad I actually heard from a friend they were decent. So Hope u keep getting bad reviews. Get better employees. Will be reporting to manager  guaranteed"
"7/23/2019","1 star ","If i could do no stars i wouldThey are rude, does not pay attention in orders and i am sure they are a cover up for drugs I mean just the way the person who delivers is im pretty sure she was high as hell‍THE STATE NEEDS TO CLOSE THIS PIZZERIA"
"7/5/2018","1 star ","Ugh.  Why didn't I check Yelp! ? I'm a teacher on vacation, recovering from foot surgery, and a military veteran... I'll tell you this food is worse than anything I ever ate in any galley.  That's saying a lot. *incorrect order*messy order*uncooked food*overpriced delivery service*food was not goodWe ordered a can of soda and they sent a liter bottle. Ordered extra fries with my order and did not receive my fries.  I called back and spoke to the restaurant and the delivery guy--they said they'd send the fries but, yeah right.  Those never came.There was pasta sauce all over the containers.The Fried Zucchini was not fully cooked--raw dough.I included two pictures--one of my raw, doughy, sloppy zucchini and the other is my pathetic looking gyro. Both made me yearn for hospital food."
"7/22/2020","1 star ","This place was the worst,  I ordered 1 large Specialty Pizza, 1 Chicken Parm, 1 Meat Ravioli, 1 Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo (add shrimp) and 1 chocolate cake. My total came out to $89.24 and my order was 3 & an half hours late, and the only thing they sent that I had ordered was chocolate cake and fried mushrooms.  I couldn't get ahold of a manager and the girl that answered the phone told me to Fuck off when I asked where my food was..bad place"
"7/27/2019","1 star ","Well all I can say I wish I would of looked at the reviews before ordering, the last that answered the phone omg, she really needs to look for a new job. It took over as n hour to get it delivered to our room, pizza was cold and tasted nasty, the spaghetti was ok lasagna looked like they just slapped pasta in there and put sauce on top of noodles, tasted ok, and they forgot our garlic bread, I should of ordered from pizza hut or dominoes but I always try to support local businesses. This was definetly a big mistake."
"10/20/2020","1 star ","Please listen to the reviews. We ordered from here because we were starving and that was the worst idea ever. Spent $100 on 1 pizza 8 wings and a soda. Got charged twice and didn't even get our soda. When I called about refunding one of the charges I've been given three run around. PLEASE LOOSEN TO THE REVIEWS"
"6/5/2020","1 star ","Ordered Gyro and Frys last night through Grubhub....HORRIBLE!!!$25.00 for what looked like a folded over pizza crust with a few nasty ingredients and sauce that smelled and tasted like puke!I'm in town on business and unfamiliar with the good late night choices here in San Antonio...Wanted to warn the next visitor"
"7/5/2019","1 star ","Not impressed! 2 hours plus and it's still not delivered. Actually very irritated. Said it would be here in 30-45 mins. Stick with the national chains at least you know what and when your getting it! This will NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!! Pissed"
"1/12/2021","1 star ","I wish I could give zero stars - Please save yourself the frustration and disappointment of ordering from here! I placed an order through UberEats, paid in full (over $60) and then after no feedback from the restaurant, I called them. A lady answered the phone with small kids in the background. She said they didn't receive the order. I asked about UberEats as the order was placed, charged and showed it was waiting on the restaurant to show it was being prepared. She repeated she didn't receive it, and couldn't help.I asked if I could just place an order with her, she said no. No offer of help or assistance in anyway. I then cancelled the UberEats order, and it advised me of a $27 cancellation charge. I called the restaurant back and advised the same lady of the cancellation charge - she said I needed to take this up with UberEats.UberEats has advised they cannot refund it as the restaurant was already preparing the order when I cancelled. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT SCAMMING! Very bad business, I should have heeded the terrible reviews before I ordered, my mistake."
"8/16/2018","1 star ","Absolute WORST business in all of San Antonio... I say that comfortably. The only reason this place still has any business is because it's the only place open late at night. We ordered a small and large greek salad. What did we receive? Two small boxes of spinach with honey mustard dressing(??) and gyro meat thrown carelessly on top. What the hell?Our calzone was burned beyond edibility. Seriously, it was charred. Absolutely unacceptable condition. The ham and cheese sandwich was fine, aside from the fact that it did not contain and tomato or lettuce as promised on the menu. Additionally, the driver didn't even carry change! How can you run a delivery business with no change? Sucked.The fact that they slid the menu under our door and then had the audacity to give us such a terrible, terrible product... I could have gotten better food at a gas station. Honestly, wish I could get a refund. DO NOT spend your money here, get a cup of noodles from CVS."
"12/4/2017","1 star ","I'll start off to the point, this PIZZA is the top 2 worst that I've ever had ! I found it to be inedible, it was soft and floppy like a dog ear probably because it was raw and doughy . I can't comprehend how a pizza could be this bad unless it was on purpose. I also had the Alfredo which was also believe it or not the worst I've ever had , the Alfredo was watery looked a thin soup broth and the chicken taste as if boiled in water . I just can't understand how someone could go through the complicated task of opening a business  then end all effort and fall short where it matters most the (PIZZA) ! This is your lively hood , bread and butter ,why wouldn't one try to make the very best pizza possible? Why wouldn't a person try the best rated pizza in town then attempt to make one better ! The reviews clearly show that customers are not at all satisfied with the extremely low quality food made here ."
"4/13/2019","2 star ","Ordered off Uber eats.Took an hourI had asked for bacon on my pizza not ham They didn't cut the pizza in slices??? Pretty bland Will not be ordering again."
"3/22/2021","1 star ","Terrible experience. I ordered for delivery. I never received my order and the delivery driver said they were very rude and unprofessional. Disappointing."
"3/15/2020","1 star ","If I could give no stars I would. Ordered the pizza and wings combo, with a salad for my wife. It took OVER 2 HOURS for them to deliver. When I finally got my food and went back up to my hotel room, there were no utensils for the salad and no dressing. The pizza had banana peppers instead of jalapeños, and the wings were lemon pepper and not hot. Over all. Absolutely terrible service and experience. DO NOT WASTE MONEY HERE."
"2/5/2021","1 star ","The had UEats delivery.  It took over an hour and a half + for delivery.  The order was cold, and wrong. The pizza crust tasted like frozen pizza dough."
"5/10/2020","1 star ","They are a disgrace wouldnt even give me a refund after they send me over cooked burnt food and doggie mushrooms wouldn't recommend them to anyone and charge u 20 delivery fee to deliver it to u"
"2/1/2019","1 star ","Awful, just awful. Hour for pizza and they went to the wrong hotel all the way downtown.Update: Just got my pizza at 11:20 and I ordered it at 9:40. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with pineapple on one half and jalapeño on the other. I got a pizza with pepperoni on half and jalapeños and pineapples on the other half and it looks like they threw some mushrooms in there for fun. Lol, this place is a joke. Don't order. They left a flyer under our hotel door and they freaking went to the wrong hotel...geez. I'm scared to eat this pizza. I wish I would have read the reviews first! I learned my lesson. Read the Yelp reviews first!!!"
"12/19/2019","1 star ","Wow.  I'm such an idiot for not looking at yelp before we ordered here. This has got to be the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  We got salads, wings, pizza and mozzarella sticks and spent $54.  Nothing was good.  My kids are still hungry and I'm so angry about the money we just wasted.  Please don't order from this place."
"11/28/2019","1 star ","Ordered 16 wings with large fries priced at $19.99 on the menu. Told me the price would be $27 with tax and delivery 2 hours later they arrive with a bill for $29 and asked for tip on top of the delivery fee. Inspected my food, got 15 wings and no fries. How the fuck is this place still in business?"
"7/5/2018","1 star ","If i could give this zero stars i would.  Ordered pizza and soda it was supposed to be the 15.99 special.    Well after the food arrived 1 hour and 40 mins later,  the pizza was cold and soda warm.  Secondly the pizza was incorrect.  Third they charged me $ 32.    I called to complain and this rude ass girl hung up on me.   THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY WITH ME.  So i go up there. That was a waste of time.  That same chick said no refunds only they owner can give refunds.    I asked for his name she said Mike but didn't know his number.  WTF!!   So now what I'm stuck with a cold pizza and charged double the price.    TRUST ME DON'T ORDER OR GO HERE.   DON'T BELIEVE ME CHECK ALL THE REVIEWS. 1 star on yelp 1 star on google reviews."
"3/22/2021","1 star ","Me and my partner ordered food from them last night to be picked up, only for them to not only send us to a random house, but also for them to be closed when we got there. We called multiple times and they didn't answer, this was completely unacceptable and judging by the previous reviews, we'll just stay away from this place. Sorry not sorry, this place sucks ‍"
"3/19/2021","1 star ","Ordered food thru Grubhub. The food that showed up was wrong. When i called the restaurant to try and figure out what was going on they told me take it up with grub hub and hung up. I guess I should've read a few of these reviews before before wasting my time and money. They only get 1 star because it won't let me leave 0."
"4/14/2018","1 star ","Worst customer service. Cursing in the background. Should have hung up when they didn't acknowledge name of business when they answered the phoneDidn't get all my food, female in background said I was full of sh*** and then the guy banged on me.  How are they even in business? Gyro was was not made not a Gyro. Don't know how they are still in business.Should have stuck with the hotel recommended pizzeria."
"12/18/2019","1 star ","Crap crap crap!! I too should have read the reviews before I ordered.  The girl who took the order was extremely RUDE. She lacked customer service skills and probably lacking in general. Hoping my food gets here warm and timely. I sure hope the manager reads these reviews so they can clean house. I'll start praying now."

"8/31/2018","1 star ","I wouldn't have given this place a star, you have to give it something to write a review. I've gotten better pizza from the microwave section at my local gas station. If you check into a hotel and their flyer is slid under the door, for the love... no matter how hangry you are - Do yourself a favor and order anything (and I do mean anything) other than this place. Bad food. Bad service."
"3/18/2018","1 star ","Um, yikes. Other pizza places are closed at 11:30 PM, okay, I get it. But holy dump, this pizza was the grossest piece of crap I've ever put in my mouth. Just imagine, a 16 inch piece of dough, flattened out with some melted  cheese on top. But even the cheese is gross. Just take your lowest expectations for pizza EVER, think about that, and then divide it by half. Even then, that will be much too high for what this ""pizza"" place delivers.This place has no business making pizzas."
"7/23/2020","1 star ","Don't order from this place!!!!  When we arrived at our hotel, 24th Street Pizzeria had slipped a flyer under our door.  We were hungry and ordered food at 9:30pm.  The lady on the phone was rude and I questioned whether we should continue with order, but we were hungry.  The lady on the phone said it would take an hour.  After almost 2 hours (at 11:15pm) we called and cancelled our order and got other food. At 12:50am, they knocked on our hotel room door and tried to deliver the food. The delivery driver said nobody told him we cancelled and was rude. What a joke of a restaurant.  RUN FAST FROM THIS PLACE!  I wish I would have looked at the reviews prior to ordering."
"12/22/2018","1 star ","Food took 2 hours. Asked for an itemized receipt and wouldn't provide one. I did the math and was over charged by 8$. Called to complain and was treated like crap. Wouldn't refund and argued how 35 plus delivery fee turned into 52. I would give a zero but it is not possible. STAY AWAYBTW. Pizza was cold and no mayo as advertised."
"12/29/2017","1 star ","This place is terrible.  I ordered a pizza, they said it would take @ 60-75 min.   Over 90 min later, I called back because order had not arrived.  The person arrived 3 hours after I place the order. The Pizza was cold & salad was room temp.  Definitely not edible.  I have called the business several times to address the issue, the employees on phone have lied to me, given false names as to who I'm speaking with or refused to give me their name or managers name. I've never seen service like this.  I'd give them 0 stars if possible.  They are terrible. Disappointed from Midwest"
"2/27/2018","1 star ","DIdn't bother to check the rating before we ordered.  Got the Gyro, absolutely horrible.  Fries weren't cooked there was virtually no meat and none of the regular condiments.Worse meal I've had in a very long time."
"4/14/2018","1 star ","I called this place at least 5 times busy signal so i called Big tony rip off pizzeria they tried to over charge me and guy was rude when i confronted him on the price. So i call 24th street rip off pizzeria and they over charged me too. Then guy says he's mgr and new employee didn't know prices.  So they drop a $40 order to the correct price $22.  WHICH IS CRAP BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS PROGRAMMED ON THE COMPUTER! Gyro $7.99 +spaghetti $7.99. Plus tax and delivery.  Order was wrong too. So i paid $20 plus tip. I can honesty say both 24th st. Pizza and Big tony pizzeria both rip offs! Miracle they are still in business! Food is mediocre and they take advantage of tourists trying to get a late night meal. Eat on the riverwalk or bring you're on food! DO NOT ALLOW THESE PLACES TO SCREW YOU OVER!"
"8/2/2018","1 star ","We were staying at La Quinta In close to the highway, they put one of their promotion peppers under our room  door and we decided to place an order. My daughter asked for a Cesar salad and the salad was disgusting. The romaine lettuce was black, there was no bacon, she requested no banana peppers and no mushrooms and they did the opposite. The delivery was late, it took more than 1 1/2 hrs. The ladies unfortunately had issues with their gps and one of them dropped one of our drinks. The pizza was completely cold.  Very bad service."
"10/6/2017","1 star ","DO NOT EAT HERE! After two rude interactions with the order taker including putting me on hold without telling me, $20+ for a small pizza, 1 hour and 15 min wait for a cold (not even warm) pizza...I've now order room service. DO NOT EAT HERE"
"11/23/2017","1 star ","Read the reviews....they are all 100% accurate. Do not bother with this place. Ordered to our hotel. Was told it could be up to an hour. Several phone calls later and our order finally showed up cold an hour and 45 mins later. The lady in the phone wasn't very nice. We ordered 2 drinks, they showed up and said sorry haven't got any. I would settle for a plastic sandwich from a gas station instead of going here!"
"12/25/2019","4 star ","I ordered through Uber eats before I saw any of these reviews. Of course I was worried after I saw all the bad reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza arrived on time, it was delicious. No issues at all. Not sure if I got lucky or maybe they've changed some things recently. Anyway the pizza was great."
"6/20/2019","1 star ","The pizza was gross, they forgot part of the order, and several ingredients in the salad had obviously gone bad. My two bites of salad had me vomiting and gave me painful diarrhea all night. Stay away. The hotel menus must be the only way that they are still in business."
"11/28/2018","1 star ","Horrible!Let's start with the good: the strawberry cheesecake was okay.The Bad: EVERYTHING ELSE! When I called to place a delivery order I was put on hold. Then the girl taking my order didn't have the same specials that were listed on the flyer in my hotel room. Delivery time: they told me they would deliver in 45 minutes but it took an hour and 20 minutes. The receipt was a crumbled up sliver of paper with nothing itemized. The salad: I ordered the garden salad with 1000 island dressing.  I got mostly lettuce and RANCH dressing.  Lots of onion and not much else.The pizza: I ordered the Hawaiian speciality pizza. It was supposed to have extra cheese with pineapple and Canadian bacon. The pizza was delivered cold. There was barely any sauce and very little cheese. Even reheated, it tasted awful. Dessert: They had a special with 2 desserts for $6.99. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and a slice of carrot cake. Instead they gave me a rocky road brownie and the strawberry cheesecake. I would never order from them again. Avoid this place."
"11/27/2018","1 star ","$11.99 pizza turns out to be $20.00.  Upon calling up the ""restaurant"" to see how my final cost went up such a large percentage without notice on the menu, I was rudely told to ""Call back to tomorrow to talk to the MGR.""Then the man hung up on me.OK pizza.Fraudulent pricing.Terrible customer service.Garbage business plan."
"11/19/2017","2 star ","Seriously kinda miffed. Pizza was eh. Totally not sure what the bacon was on the pizza. But it wasn't like any bacon I've had before. Gross and felt uncooked. Lesson learned. Definitely won't order from you guys again. . But I ordered garlic bread. Asked that it be lightly toasted with extra garlic butter. Paid $1.79 for 1 slice of bread. 1 small slice of bread. I thought I would get a bit more than that. I could have bought a whole loaf of bread and made myself garlic bread for that price. This place is a little overpriced for what you get. I won't be ordering from here again. I just thought I'd try them since I'm new to the area and don't know what the good pizza places are."
"12/13/2017","1 star ","AwfulOver an hour late, chick on the phone is rude, won't listen and appears to be extremelyBothered by your call . Called after I waited forever and she just said the driver is out and hung up on me Don't waste your money** update** now 2 hrs later I call to find out what's going on, the girl on the phone gets an attitude and says she'll call the driver, yells at me, and hangs up I still do not have my food but they certainly charged me for the order"
"4/19/2017","1 star ","An hour and 40 minutes + four phone conversations with the cashier + a calzone delivery WITHOUT the calzone, ( how does someone forget to delivery THE ONLY entree in the whole delivery?! ) only to be topped off with finally getting a chance to talk to the ""assistant Mgr""..... HA. The ""assistant manager"" comes on the phone (not because he wanted to help, because I forced the conversation), and rather than understanding my frustrations and helping to clear everything up, gets his feelings hurt and yells back at me that he doesn't care about how I f****ng feel.Needless to say, whether you are looking for pizza or just looking for delivery, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST."
"4/20/2017","1 star ","Lady on the phone was ridiculously rude. Order took well over the quoted 45 min and when I called and realized I'd sent them to the wrong hotel (across the street, wrong, not other side of town wrong) we waited another 30+ min before we called again and told them to forget it. Didn't stop them from sending the delivery boy, who was rude too. Told him I'd already cancelled my order and I wasn't doing it.Wish I'd read the reviews before I ordered."
"7/17/2019","1 star ","Got the flyer under the door of our hotel and ordered. They wanted our room number but we kept telling them to just meet us in the lobby. Talked to the lady at the hotel and she said that they were horrible and not to order from them. She was also saying that company was not allowed in the hotel but they sneak in to put the flyers under the door and they keep kicking them out. Took FOREVER for them to show up. The pizza was cold and crust was not cooked completely. Oh and how it was cut was the most ridiculous way ever, wish I would have gotten a picture but the person who cut it had to be high, we actually think the restaurant may be a cover for drugs. Wish we would have yelped this first. Don't order from here."
"5/19/2018","1 star ","Very disappointed in the business. We order pizza, lasagna, spaghetti, fried pickles and fried mozzarella. Nothing was edible. Pizza was undercooked. Pickles were burnt and rubbery. Was over charged for everything and wasn't left with a receipt. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Wish we would have checked the reviews before we ordered."
"9/28/2018","1 star ","I received a flyer under my hotel room door. I should have taken the time to read the reviews. This place is horrible, from the order taker, to the delivery driver and the burnt stale food delivered. A score of 1 is too good for this place. This place should be completely shutdown. It took two hours to get the order. Check out the pictures"
"3/4/2017","2 star ","Ordered using UberEats.  Cool concept. Didn't check reviews before ordering. My fault. Ordered Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, Wings, Calzone, cheesecake, chocolate cake. The chicken fettuccine was spaghetti noodles not fettuccine, it was bland and tastes very frozen dinner, cheesecake and chocolate cake were both bad, definitely store bought/frozen type.  The wings were Buffalo flavored and were pretty good and the calzone was best of everything. So overall I would give it 2.5 1 star for chicken fettuccine, cheesecake and chocolate cake, 3 stars for wings and 4 stars for calzone."
"9/26/2020","1 star ","Ordered through a delivery app and the whole order was wrong. I called to ask about it and in the middle of the conversation the guy hung up on me and I called back saying that I was trying I ask him a question.... anyway I totally get that the guy who dropped if off working for the delivery app gave me the wrong order but when I tried to reorder and get a NEW order through the pizza place  directly, they canceled my order and didn't want to deliver to me. Ok then, fuck my business I guess! I should have looked at the reviews before giving them any business! HORRIBLE REVIEWS FOR A REASON!! The wrong order I received was stone cold and gross looking. PLEASE DONT EAT HERE!"
"10/30/2016","1 star ","This pizza place is the absolute worst. Don't give them business. I ordered 2 smalll salads and a large pizza.  40 dollars later the lettuce was wilted and just horrible. I work at a pizza place in Austin. The ""large "" pizza is not the size they say it is. And tastes like it's 3 days old. I called back the restaurant and the ""manager"" I spoke to fought me tooth and nail. Not someone that should own a business. He was combative and incredibly ignorant  . He could care less if we actually liked the product they sold for us for again ""40"" dollars. As somebody in the industry , i am letting y'all know this is not a place to order from when you go out of town"
"9/7/2019","1 star ","I gave this place a second try, because the first time they messed up one of my pizzas toppings. But this time, the pizza was terrible. Burnt. Only pepperoni. No other toppings. I paid for two extra toppings. Very dissatisfied. Very disappointed again."
"9/7/2019","1 star ","Was visiting San Antonio when we decided to order pizza, pasta and wings. The wings were just ok, the pasta was a little burnt and didn't have much sauce on it and while eating the pizza we found a hair cooked into the cheese. Was not happy at all learned to check with yelp first before ordering"
"4/8/2018","1 star ","I placed an order through Uber eats not knowing about this place. They placed myOrder back 45 minutes from set time of delivery. I decided to call the pizzeria twice no answer.... I canceled my order after seeing the poor reviews one food and management. I don't appreciate them not communicating with me. . . I understand it's Sunday, it's close to closing time... but no matter what you should answer phone calls... answer costumers questions.... never again."
"7/15/2019","1 star ","HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!! Told my order would take 40mins, my card was run & 2hrs later NO PIZZA! Called and was told it would be delivered in a few mins... waited & NO DELIVERY! Called back and asked where my order was, put on hold and then was told my order was on its way, asked for an estimated time since I was already told it should've been delivered a few minutes, the guy couldn't give me a time which then he became very ugly, and said that he would cancel my order, refund my money back because I was not going to be happy & hung up on me. About 30mins later we get a knock at our door and the delivery guy is at the door. The food was HORRIBLE! Pizza was not cooked all the way, all doughy, salad (geek salad) was welted, the meat smelled moldy, and the fried mushrooms were soggy and the batter was disgusting. Overall I'd give this restaurant a - Star review. NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGIAN. HORRIBLE SERVICE, OVER 2 1/2 HR WAIT FOR HORRIBLE FOOD!"
"6/30/2018","1 star ","Same as everyone else. This place slides their menus under the doors of hotels. It's been two hours, and we still haven't received our order. We called and were told that they were calling the driver and would call us back. They never did. We called again and were told it would be 15 more minutes...that was 30 minutes ago. Definitely should've checked the reviews first.Update: just called back to cancel because it's been over 2 hours, and the woman yelled at us and refused to take the charge off of the credit card. Then she hung up on us."
"4/29/2019","1 star ","I ordered my food at 11:30.. They had the audacity to wake me up at 2:00am after hearing nothing about my order for hours.... It was really unprofessional and just absolutely ridiculous.. I do not recommend. I was already iffy about ordering due to the one star."
"6/25/2020","2 star ","Ordered through doordash. I xhecked the online menu and the menu on doordash and I've been eating there for man, many years.  I know the food is pretty good.  I ordered a Stromboli with a house salad.  The salad vegetables were old but at least the dressing was good. There is not an option to order extra marinara sauce or even marinara sauce at all.  I got to eat my Stromboli dry.  When I called them the guy said it doesnt come with marinara, only the calzone does. I explained that it had every time I'd eaten there in person.  He had no reply.  CALL before you order online.  Customer service is not good.  Doordash rocks though."
"7/5/2018","1 star ","We are here from out of town... LA to be exact ordered a large pizza at 8:55 pm our pizza came at 10:40pm cold AF!!! We ordered from them cause when we checked in they had their advertisement in the room meaning that they cater to hotel delivery. NOPE!!! Horrible customer service!! I had to call 3 times to find out when the pizza was coming!!! So far not a good look !!! Being a out of state customer I know that I won't be ordering from this place again when I come back to San Antonio!!! This place is shady af !!! Don't go here!!! Also when looking at my charges the double the charges!  I went to the establishment to speak to the rude ass person who hung up the phone .... I asked to speak to the manager she said he was out making deliveries she didn't know what time he would be back!!! Really ?? Then I asked for the owners name I just his name is ""mike"" I don't know his last name!!  Really u work for someone and u don't know his last name???Needless to stay when going to this establishment it was dirty AF!!! Had I known I would had never ordered for a place like this!! I spoke with the hotel and asked if the supported this establishment and I was told NO that they had even called the police on them with regards to these matter!!! Well since I find it my obligation to advise for future buyers!! Don't waste your time, this is place is BELOW A ZERO!! I hope the owners read this also!!! On a last note!! Yes I'm that person!! I filed a complaint with San Antonio BBB!!! It's a health issue and issue with charges!! I'm sure this type of place makes there money on ppl who are from out of town and just figured to hell with it!! Well not me!!! I want action... trust and believe I will be following up on this matter with the BBB!! Can't stress it enough!!! Don't go to this establishment and get over charged and have to deal with RUDE ASS PPL WHO ACT LIKE YOU OWE THEM SOMETHING!!!"
"3/31/2020","1 star ","Pizza wasn't cooked all the way thru toppings were wrong just a spot of sauce. Toppings that were on it wasn't fit for a dog. But I ordered thru Uber eats do not sure if they have pre made items sitting ready for quick cooking times or what. Delivery was unbelievably fast probably explains the raw dough I was served. Next time I'll just have a microwave pizza anything but this place."
"6/26/2018","1 star ","Where do I begin, . . so many issues I will just list them in bullet point.* The order didn't arrive on time* The pizza was cold and tasted nasty, poor quality* The hot wings, stuffed peppers, fried mushrooms were freezer burned* The fried mushrooms were old and mushy* The pizza was not fully cooked, raw dough throughout* They over charged* They are very rude* Be aware they solicit, if you're in a hotel nearby or off of 151 by Sea World they may slip their menu under your door."
"6/27/2017","1 star ","Should have checked he reviews before presuming aggressive advertising meant a better business. Ordered a large 3 topping special (where i requested black olives, Canadian bacon, and pineapple) with a 2 liter soda (requested Dr. Pepper) special for $15.99, plus an order of garlic cheese bread for $2.49, was told on the phone to expect a 45 minute wait, which seemed strange for 8 pm on a Tuesday evening. Driver had me meet him outside, so though I did notice in the dark that the large was what anyone else would call a medium, I did not realize the pizza came with Canadian bacon over the whole thing, black olives on only one half, and no pineapple, plus was not very hot despite eating it immediately after getting it back to our room. When I got the 2 liter out of the bag it was root beer instead of Dr. Pepper. Then the garlic cheese bread was 1/4 of a small loaf of Italian about 5"" with a bit of mozzarella barely melted together but not enough to melt into the bread.Worse, I realized after I got in that the receipt I signed in the dark was for $37.89, which would have $33.15 before tax + $2 delivery fee for what should have been $18.48 (and I added a tip onto that). There is a line of fine print about a delivery fee applying, but no mention that the fee was a random number approximately the same as the order amount."
"1/18/2019","1 star ","Worst place ever!!! Do not order from here!!! Food took over 2.5 hours to deliver (quoted 45minutes to 1 hour). I called 3 times asking where the food was, guy on phone kept saying ""be there in 10 minutes"" what a liar! Food was cold, soggy, tasted disgusting, and 2 out of the 5 items were made wrong!!! Ordered mozzarella sticks, they looked like they were from a microwave!! Wish I could give 0 out 5 stars!! Terrible place, just terrible!!!"
"8/19/2018","1 star ","I should have read the reviews first! This place is awful. I was visiting San Antonio for the week and it was late on a Friday night. Decided to give this place a try. I ordered a 3 meat calzone with fries, an 8 piece order of lemon pepper wings and a slice of caramel fudge cheesecake. An hour and a half later, I get a calzone that was burnt on top, undercooked in the middle and unseasoned, soggy, unseasoned fries and some plain ""cheesecake"" that they put in the bag with the fries so it was hot and looked melted. All of it tasted horribly and ended up in the trash. Oh, and instead of wings, I received someone else's pizza. I called the restaurant back (I had to call 6 times from 2 different phones before someone answered) to tell them I received a pizza instead of the wings I ordered. Now, almost 2 hours since then, I STILL don't have my wings and I don't want them. WORST food and WORST service ever. Do not waste your time or money.**UPDATE** I drove to the restaurant to get my money back. Robert (who claims he was not on the clock but only there to help out) offered to make my meal over again, but if it was garbage the first time then I certainly don't want a second order. I said no - just give me my money back. He says he will make my same order ""perfectly"" and also make me an order of my choosing tomorrow, but he didn't have the authority to refund my $30. So, he had the authority to waste another $60 in food but not to refund my money?? Ok. Plus, the place is FILTHY. Robert is sweating, wiping his head with his bare hands and telling me how he's helping to do everyone's job. He then proceeds to tell me how busy the restaurant is and how 14 people including all of the cooks and cashiers are out doing deliveries. What kind of business practice is that?? I then asked for the manager's name because the conversation with Robert was getting absurd. He tells me ""Mike Jones."" At this point, I am too through. He says he will have the manager call me tomorrow, but I told him I'll just be back up there and make sure I voice my concerns right in the middle of the store where all of the [potential] customers can hear.This place needs to be shut down. The establishment is disgusting, service is sub par, the food is atrocious and the audacity of this Robert to argue me down about this piss poor excuse of a restaurant just blows my mind."
"2/5/2019","1 star ","Not sure how serious the owners are taking the Yelp reviews, but I couldn't see anyone ordering from here with so many negative reviews. It seems as though it may be just a write off instead of a true business."

I called after an hour when it was supposed to be delive​red. Called and the guy who answered had no clue where his driver was and sounded like he didn't care. Called again after 2 hours and still nothing, and the guy told me if it's not there by now it won't come and hung up on me. I called back to speak to a manager, and the same guy said are you serious. Manager sounded like she wasn't going to talk to her rude employees.  DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!"
"6/23/2017","1 star ","NEVER AGAIN!!! Called to order a pizza with salad and pepperoni bread and the people were very unprofessional! Never gave us a time frame on when the food would be here and didn't give a total. After an 1 hour and 20 min we finally called and said to cancel the order they tried to argue with us and then make excuses on why it was taking so long. After being assertive and telling them that we didn't want the food so forget it they hung up on us. Luckily we did not give credit card information!! The guy showed up 15 min later and our hotel called us saying that they were here. We explained the situation to the front desk and they sent them away. Apparently the driver looked dirty and the manager of the hotel stated he was calling to tell this place to never send the driver again. The people then tried calling back. Yeah nope!NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!"

"11/25/2019","5 star ","I was impressed! Based on the reviews I was skeptical, but everything came out delicious. Pizza was perfect and the wings were good! I will definitely eat here again. I had it delivered through Uber eats and it took under an hour. I recommend!"
"5/29/2018","1 star ","We wanted a good delivery service and just chill out in our hotel. We called this place, ordered 2 salads, a calzone and 8 wings. They said the total was $46. My husband questioned the price the lady on the phone started using foul language and was completely rude. We cancelled the ordered and a man took the phone and called my husband a ""cheap bastard"" the reviews are horrible for a reason. I'm sure the food would've been too. Glad we dodged the bullet. So many other places to order from!"
"6/24/2018","1 star ","Never again!!!  We were staying at a hotel near by and we decided to order from this restaurant since we saw a flyer in the hotel room, I should of changed my mind as soon as the person picked up. The woman was rude as she took my order and when the food got to us about 2 hours later, the food was horrible. Philly cheese steak didn't look or taste like one, pizza was cold and very greasy, And chicken alfredo... I make better chicken alfredo. Do not order from here or you will be disappointed !"
"2/13/2019","1 star ","100% Disappointing. I have stayed at the same hotel my last few trips to San Antonio and these people are scary putting them and us in danger by roaming the halls placing flyers under the doors. The hotel has reported this behavior multiple times and it still continues. They sneak in. Dangerous Stupid and I would never eat here because they threaten my ability to feel safe."
"4/2/2017","1 star ","Horrible!!!..... I should have read the reviews first.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.....Note to the owner and/or management team : in an area that is dependent upon tourist money and activity, one would be led to believe that a pizza shop located in such a competitive market would make every attempt to rise above its competitors by first, producing a good product. Second, by assuring that people are getting delivered what they paid for and thirdly, if you make a mistake don't be rude when it is brought to your attention. You should do everything in your power to prevent someone like me from ever writing such a negative review about your business. Grubhub should not partner with this establishment.....association with horrible customer service does not equate to a favorable financial outcome for either parties."
"4/7/2018","5 star ","I ordered the Supreme Pizza through UBER EATS. It was a very cold night so the pizza by the time it arrived was cold. I put it on the oven for 10 minutes and it just became one of the best pizzas I ever had in San Antonio. The pizza dough is spectacular. Even that I live in Alamo Heights and the pizzeria is far from my house, it is definitely worth the wait."

Absolutely the worse food experience I've ever had!!!!"
"7/7/2017","1 star ","I wouldn't feed my dog this food. Desperate and hungry, I quickly called and ordered from a flyer they slid under my hotel room door. Crazy of me not to read the reviews first, because I could've save $30. All I ordered was spaghetti and a brownie and wondered why the man never gave me my total over the phone. The whole place is scandalous. He was so eager for my card number without even having my full order. Took over an hour and a half to deliver after saying 30-45 min. PLEASE save your time and money! I threw away the whole order. It didn't even LOOK good and smelled like old canned food."
"7/29/2019","2 star ","We stayed downtown for a military ball. Reading the reviews, we lucked out... maybe bc we ordered early in the evening? They got our hotel confused with another nearby one through the same chain, but our delivery guy was nice and very apologetic. The spaghetti and lasagna we ordered was pretty good. Very generic, but nonetheless, it was saucy and very cheesy."
"8/29/2018","1 star ","Ordered a gyro late at night from the hotel room after a late flight. Food was delivered in 30 minutes but was delivered by the most shady dude. Made me a little nervous. The guy was nice though, just shady looking. Gyro was sloppy and the fries were super soggy and cold. The gyro tasted okay but couldn't eat the fries. We'll see if I suffer any I'll effects later. The guy on the phone belched super loud when answering the phone, ha. It was quite surprising. Would not EVER order from here again."
"6/22/2017","1 star ","Out with the kids on vacation and ordered a pepperoni pizza and 8 wings. This has to be the driest pizza ever, the pepperonis literally have no flavor, and the buffalo wings I ordered are even drier and burnt. What a waste of 30 dollars. I usually look up reviews before eating somewhere I don't know but we came up from swimming and ordered from flier in hotel room. If I could rate no stars I would."
"6/10/2017","1 star ","Ordered 2 large for delivery . 1hour and 40 minutes later no pizza and shop will not even answer the phone. My bad. Should have checked Yelp first."
"7/12/2018","1 star ","Ordered a pizza from here,delivery drivery was nasty and so was his car. The pizza had zero taste!!!! It was under cooked and burnt at the same time. Seriously! Do not order!"
"11/1/2018","1 star ","Horrible pizza!!!!First off, the guy who took our order had no idea what he was doing. I said I needed to pay with a credit card and he said can you pay with cash, said hold on, got a manager who put  our credit card through. Everything tasted old and we were sick from just a few bites. Just like all of you I really wished I would've checked the reviews. Let's all remember to always check the reviews weather we're in our own town or another town, where ever we are."
"6/13/2017","1 star ","2nd chances don't come often and I definitely won't give it a 3rd. Our first time ordering we were told it'll be a 45min-1hr wait. After 1hr and 15mins I placed a call to check on a status and was told it should be on the way. 45mins later we finally got our ""cold"" pizza! This was a Saturday night so I understand it could be busy but seriously! Second order was a $17.99 special (1lg pizza and 8pc wings) I asked for a total and the lady says she's not at the register at the moment but it's a $4 delivery charge plus tax. I asked how long and she says 40-45mins. (I shouldn't have to ask!) An hour later and no food yet. I called to check on it and was told he just left. When he finally arrived he says $26. No hello or hi, just a total that was more than what I was quoted. And again... cold pizza! And... 7pc wings. Unprofessional, poor customer service skills and poor food."
"3/30/2018","3 star ","Ordered pizza and wings, meatball sub and cheesesteak sub.  Pizza was good, subs were good.  Wings could have been crispier."
"8/11/2019","1 star ","We have never been to San Antonio and we were looking for a pizza place to eat at. This place would receive 0 stars if I could rate it. We checked reviews after finding this place on Uber and read terrible reviews so we called the pizzeria to ask for some information and give this establishment a fair shot. The lady who answered the phone was rude and had the worst attitude on earth. She was so bothered by simple questions as if everyone on earth that has never been to this place should know everything about this place.. She literally asked us to get to the point while we were on the phone with her. This happened 8/11 at 10:36pm. I'm writing this post so that every single person on the internet reading the reviews on this place doesn't think these reviews are a mistake. This place is god awful and the only reason they seem to have stayed afloat is because everyone in San Antonio does not have internet access and is unable to view the horribleness they are about to experience. I can not believe any person would allow a business to be run the way that this place is and I would honestly not be surprised if this place disappeared within the next 2-3 years as the world becomes more interconnected. I mean seriously whatever kind of person is doing the hiring here should have never been trusted with a business let alone your personal information. I can only imagine that everything here runs mediocrely just by a simple phone call and seeing everyone's burned pizza pictures. Thank you yelp for helping us avoid a disaster. If you choose to eat here after reading this, YOU DUG YOUR OWN GRAVE."
"6/24/2017","1 star ","Ordered pizza to our hotel room, lady I ordered from told me she didn't have the total but would send the receipt with the food. So after an hour and a half it gets here. They forgot our 2 liter and we were charged $35.00. This pizza is probably the saddest pizza I've ever seen....pure soft dough...disgusting...if I could give them a negative score I would...just don't order from this business it's disgusting and unprofessional..."
"10/23/2017","1 star ","They left a flyer under my hotel door. I called five or six times for an hour and NO ONE PICKED UP. this was at 8 pm on a Wednesday & Thursday. two days in row!!! I'm not sure what was goin on but that's awful business practice."
"4/29/2018","1 star ","Worst customer service I've ever heard from. Lady who answered was rude and claimed pizza was already on its way when the Uber tracker shows it's still being prepared but the lady said it was already sent. All I wanted was Parmesan cheese but it's the last time I order through you guys"
"6/11/2017","1 star ","Ordered tonight (Sunday night) at 7pm, they told us 45min- an hour for delivery.. we called back at 8:30, they said it was still on the way, called back at 9 and they were very rude and unprofessional, the guy hung up on us because we were asking where our pizza was. So we decided to just go get food elsewhere, came back to our hotel and we're about to sleep and they came to the door at 10:30, and called saying did we order a pizza !!!! Yeah 3.5 hours ago!!!!! Worst place ever! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!"
"4/21/2017","1 star ","We ordered and were told that it would be an hour wait. Fast forward 1.5 hours later - still no pizza. We called, they said our order was out for delivery and would arrive any second. 10 minutes later, still no pizza - so we called and canceled. Then, 2 hours and 10 minutes after we ordered, the pizza delivery guy arrived with our order. We told him we canceled and refused to accept the order. Absolutely horrible delivery timing and it wasn't even a weekend night."
"5/3/2018","1 star ","Worst customer service! Delivery took 2 hours and half long. Delivery guy rude! Pizza didn't taste well it was cold!"
"8/23/2018","1 star ","Shit. My order was meant to be a bacon cheeseburger pizza and I received a pepperoni pizza with literally 7 pepperonis on it. I also ordered the fried mushrooms and a gryo. The batter on the mushrooms was pretty much raw and the gyro had almost no meat and had a chunk or clear plastic in it that I bit down on and could have chipped a tooth. Do NOT order from this restaurant."
"6/11/2019","1 star ","Food was gross. Seemed like they had it under a heat lamp for awhile because it was soft. The fried pickles was the only good thing I received but I paid 8.99 for 8 nickel sized pieces."
"4/19/2018","1 star ","Only one star because I can't give them zero. Delivery Oder shows after an hour and a half. Combo of wings, fries, and a two liter drink showed at my door with no drink, short 4 wings, and an order of fries with about 5 fries in it.  Called store and they said the charges for the food would be adjusted.  It never happened. Now they won't talk on the phone. This is basically theft. Next week when I'm in town I will stand at there front door and call the police about theft charges on the night manager.  Don't waste you time or money on this place. I'll be working hard to get this place shutdown."
"7/6/2017","1 star ","I would give less than 1 star if I could. My fault i didn't check reviews before I ordered. I'm from out of town and ordered delivery to my hotel, 2 hours later and still no food. I called and the driver answered and said he went to 3 holiday inns and couldn't find mine. Really!?They had my number, but the driver or the store never called me. The mgr said she would send him right back and I asked, with the food you made 2 hours ago? I insisted they remake the food and have it here within a 1/2 hour. Still waiting......next call is to amex to claim fraud on the charge. Worst delivery experience EVER!"
"1/14/2018","1 star ","Someone told me that they stay open late and deliver quickly so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and give him a call I ordered a combination pizza and some spicy wings. Your order got here an hour later the messed up on the order and gave me just a sausage pizza. So I called them back and they said they're going to send me another Pizza the right pizza. They never came and now I have to call them in the morning to make sure that they deliver my pizza later today. I do not recommend this place"
"7/4/2018","1 star ","Trust the reviews! I as well ordered thru  uber eats  never again. Just glad I got my money back."
"6/22/2018","1 star ","Unfortunately, I didn't look up the rating before we ordered. While we are at the Hilton San Antonio Hill Country we receive a menu under our door so we decided to order dinner out. I called but they needed the address of the hotel so I said hold on and she hung up on me. I called back, made the order and said it was gonna be an hour for delivery. The order came an hour late so two hours after I placed it. The pizza was cold with barely any cheese, the spaghetti sauce was not good and the container was barely filled. The garlic bread wasn't good either and was cold. The good thing is my kids liked their wings which were lemon pepper and teriyaki. They need to work on food quality and customer service."
"10/13/2018","1 star ","Food showed up warmish at best. No ranch dressing for the rubbery chicken wings. My fault for ordering late night food at the hotel. Won't make this mistake ever again.  Quoted 45-55 minutes. Closer to 65-70 minutes."
"2/15/2018","1 star ","My first time ordering here to my hotel, and I will not order again. After waiting an hour, I called to see where my order was, they said someone was coming. 30 min later I called again, still was told someone was on the way and they hung up on me. Finally, I called to cancel the order, and they said I could not cancel because I paid with a credit card. I will cancel with my credit card company, but this place is a complete scam."
"12/27/2017","1 star ","After 2 and a half hours they still haven't delivered...and lied to us 3 times about when it would be here...nasty people?answering phone...stay away !!! Terrible experience ...my worst ever on Yelp and my first one star review and that's only because you can't give them a negative number!"
"7/12/2019","1 star ","I missed my cousins bridal shower because I couldn't leave the toilet after eating this pizza the night before!"
"4/29/2017","1 star ","The absolute worst $40 ever spent. Just disgusting. Not to mention the delivery guy couldn't understand a word I said. Never again"
"9/11/2018","1 star ","Should have read the reviews before ordering. They are only good at sliding flyers under doors. Ordered 1 hour and 40 minutes ago. Told 50 minutes. After 4 calls and repeatedly told it is almost there, I finally told them don't bother"
"1/17/2018","1 star ","I wish yelp would allow zero stars. Absolutely horrible food and even worse service. Didn't deliver the right food and delivery person showed up in pjs (including slippers). Food took over an hour and was cold. We offered our dog a piece of the crust before we threw it all away and she didn't even want it."
"1/6/2018","1 star ","Can you give zero stars???   Never ever have left a review but this is so bad I had too!!!  Flyer left under door at embassy suites so I thought it would be ok. Wrong!!!! Ordered and they said 26 minutes to an hour... alright. 70 morning later called and they said any minute. 90 minutes later same thing.... finally got my cold pizza and guy had no change.., I guess he thoughtThe change was all his for his exceptional service ???  All I can say is just don't order from these guys.  No No NO!!"
"8/21/2019","1 star ","I order Spaghetti and Meatballs which was rubbery at 8.99, Salad at 3.39 and a Coke at 1.39 and charged 30.00 dollars.   The driver arrived 2 hours laterrrrrrrr.....I asked him what happened and he said he has many hotels to deliver to.  I looked at the receipt and called to talk to the Manger.  I was told by the owner / manager that I would be refunded my money since he charged me twice for tips.  I was like, but you have a tip line on the receipt.  Do not order from this place.  I have an outstanding credit dispute.  If you are going to charge, then tell the customer how much and why so as the customer does not leave another tip.   The food is not that great and I would nor recommend ordering from this place.   The quality of food is bad and getting over charged is not acceptable."
"11/14/2018","1 star ","I am very glad I didn't have to eat this pizza, after the experience I had with this place I am not sure how quality this pizza would've been. After reading this reviews on this place and looking at the Yelp stats I had to try this place for myself, most reviews seemed dramatic and I just really wanted to know what the fuss was all about. I decided to place the order over the phone for pickup (Some reviews complained about delivery times and some people did not receive their pizza at all). I ordered one large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, i was told my total was $5.30 and it would be ready in 20 minutes. I left to get the pizza and arrived at the restaurant maybe 25 minutes after the order was placed. Pulling into the driveway was a little scary but I made it in to find there was no parking lot, i had to park at the next property at a mechanic shop (which also had no parking but i was able to find an open area to park in). There was several doors on the building and as I walked around the entire building i saw that only one door was unlocked (A room which happened to be an apartment that i assume the owner of the restaurant was renting out). After this awkward encounter with the man renting the apartment, I rechecked all the doors to make sure I wasn't missing something (Like perhaps the pile dog feces on the path to what I thought was the front door). As i began to leave a car pulls up, driving literally on the sidewalk which i was standing. The man (which i assume is the owner of the restaurant) rolls down the window and notifies me that the establishment will be open in about 30 minutes. This was at 5:00 pm on a Wednesday, the hours of operation of this restaurant on Wednesdays is, according to Yelp, 11am-1am, So I was a little shocked to hear this, especially considering the woman on the phone took my order and told me that the Pizza would be ready at 5pm. After hearing this news I left the establishment as soon as possible, without my pizza."
"4/30/2019","5 star ","I found this pizzeria on accident I give it a try it did not disappoint. The pizza was good even though I live 15 minutes from here I would definitely come back and I recommend this place. There was four of us total and all of us like the pizza. We are looking forward to trying more food from here."
"4/7/2018","1 star ","Awful service, I called to place order in which I was told it would be a 30 minute wait. When I went to pick up my order, I was told my order was given away to someone else and had to wait for it to be remade. After I received my order, one pizza was half cooked, I called to explain the issue in which I was told by a young lady she would replace the pizza, by making another herself and to take back the half cooked pizza. 5 mins later once I got back to place, young lady said guys would replace it and quickly left. This replacement pizza was burned from the edges and also poorly made. Never going back."
"4/2/2018","1 star ","Wow!!  They mess up the order completely and then tell us if we don't want it just send it back!   No offer to fix it, offer a discount or anything.   They did not even care that they messed up.  Apparently throwing away pizza is a better option for them.   If I could give no stars that is what I would give this place.   Do yourself a favor and order from anywhere else and NOT from them."

"12/16/2019","5 star ","Hello fellow aficionados of fine dining. My name is Chef Chuggs, profession chef and author of the critically acclaimed cook book Lick the Wooden Spoon. And I would like to share my dining experience at the finest eating establishment ever established for eating. 24th Street Pizza. I had high expectations for the eatery and oh boy was I not disappointed. From the second I called in to order my pizza the graceful woman who took my order immediacy hung up on me, obviously because she was attending to other customers. You see, that's what a good business owner should do. I ordered a large sausage pizza for me and a couple of friends of mine. I ordered it at exactly 4:20 pm, it arrived at 6:09. My friends had already left at that point angry, as they had actual lives to attend to. But hey more pizza for me, am I right? The second my fingers grazed that cardboard box I knew my mouth was in for an exciting ride. And I wasn't wrong. When I opened the box I was greeted by a culinary delight that was somehow both frozen but also blazing hot, best of both worlds. The dirty oven that it was cooked in provided extra flavor as well as the mold on top. And that crust, oh my god! When it tastes like charcoal, that's when it's the best. I felt like I was back home at my grandma's house. Even after I was ton I felt yet another treat lurking into my mouth, I fished it out. And much to my surprise I was greeted by a long black curly hair. Good thing, I needed floss anyway. My meal was followed by a session of intense vomiting. My stomach is clear, and I know what I'm gonna do now. Go get another pizza at 24th Street."
"7/7/2018","1 star ","I got a paper in my hotel room today and thought to try it out. The lady on the phone wasn't very polite and very quick to talk, like she wanted off the call as soon as possible. That raised a red flag right away. Came on here to check it out and found out why. I quickly cancelled my order, again to a quick ""Okay bye"". Not happy about this place at all and that was just from the phone call"
"3/8/2018","5 star ","First time trying this place & it was bomb. Pizza has this buttery taste I'm not sure if it's the bread or the cheese but it makes it so good. Took about 20 mins and only costed $5 for a large pepperoni pizza! If your in the neighborhood you should definitely try it. The girl that answer the phone doesn't seem friendly but other than that, it was good!! Definitely be going back for more!"
"7/20/2019","1 star ","This place is terrible. No joke DON'T GO HERE! We ordered our pizza at 9:30pm and called one and half a hour later to see where our pizza was and they said it was in delivery. They were very rude too. We ended up waiting 2 hours and when they came we didn't even take the pizza. We told them about the complaint and the deliverer was very rude. We found the flyers under our hotel door and 100% should have read reviews before buying. Literally the only way they are still in business is my putting flyers under hotel room doors. TERRIBLE!!!"
"1/13/2018","1 star ","HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE FOOD on 01/12/2018 we ordered for delivery to our hotel. I  requested for my total i was placed on hild then hung up on. I called right back and I was told 23.62 when delivery driver showed up total was 28.98. I questioned the delivery driver he said let me call the store my phone is in the car he walked outside and he drove off. I called the restaurant the lady answered the phone was very rude and hung up on me. This is HORRIBLE service and the food is HORRIBLE as well all the food is cold!!"
"5/5/2018","1 star ","This has to be the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. The lady working the delivery phone line hung up on us multiple times for no reason and had the biggest attitude problem. After hanging up on me for the 3rd time, once I called back, she claimed I was the one hanging up even though I clearly wasn't. After that, she copped the most attitude about how she's ""been ready"" for the card number after she hung up when I took more than a minute to find my payment card. The way I was treated by the lady working deliveries was horrible and she was so rude to me for absolutely no reason. This lady needs to be fired for how incredibly rude she was to a customer for no reason!!!!!"
"12/19/2017","1 star ","0 stars! Just found out this place is a scam the cops are looking for them and they change their location and name when ever the cops get close. Took our money with no food in return. Talked to the hotel we stayed at and they said they have children running through the halls throwing flier out so the adults don't get caught. What a waste of society."
"12/17/2017","1 star ","Thieft of service!! This is the worst place ever. Had a flier in our hotel room saying they deliver till 3am. Called at 1:15am they said I'm busy hold on and hung up. I called 3 more times and every time it was the same thing. Finally they take my order at 1:20 am. I waited and waited and then realized it's 3:18 am and I still don't have my pizza. Oh and my card was charged as soon as I gave them the number. I call back and the lady says we're closed in which I told her i haven't received my order, doesn't ask for any info just says it's on the way. So I asked if it's coming to the hotel and gave them the address and before I could finish she said ya and hung up. Well no food came and my card is charged so we drove to there business at 11:30 am to find out why I was charged for something I didn't get. Well there closed so we drive back home, which is not in  San Antonio and wait to call when they open. Well time got away from me and my husband called at 8pm and says he needs to speak to a manager. The girl on the phone says she is and when my husband starts explaining she starts cussing at him and saying I didn't steal your f*ing money and then yelling at another worker ""I don't know what hos f*ing problem is I can't deal with this f*ing shit"". So then a guy gets on the phone, who isn't much better. They had our wrong phone number and wrong address and just continued to lie about everything and they said they didn't charge us well it's on my card so ya you did. It ended with we'll let our manager know and he'll contact you. I have a feeling that I'm not getting my money back from this crooked company"

"11/16/2017","1 star ","No stars if allowed Chicken fettuccine was bland. Fried mushrooms came with No dipping sauce and tasted like they were fried in old grease,did not come with horseradish sauce  The bread in the picture is supposed to be cheese sticks.  Ordered strawberry cheesecake came with no strawberry. Waste of $39.00 . (Delivered right at an hour)"
"5/25/2019","1 star ","Ordered fried pickles and mozzarella sticks on Uber eats. IT IS LITERALLY MICROWAVES FROZEN FOOD YOU CAN GET AT WALMART!!!! And it was cold after a 10 min drive. And Who eats friend pickles with pizza sauce EW I couldn't even eat it"

"1/26/2019","1 star ","These people sneak into hotels, even when they've been asked not to, they lie to the people at the front desk and then insinuate themselves into the vacation of others, slipping coupons under the doors or knocking or handing them out and then when accosted by Hotel staff they run. People who would practice those sort of business ethics, why would you ever trust them with your food let alone your credit card information?"
"10/27/2017","1 star ","Just ordered through UberEats. They did not remember the ranch or extra ranch I ordered for my wings, which were all fat with barely any chicken and tasted like garbage. Did not include the extra garlic bread I paid for. Frozen meatball in spaghetti. How is this place open?? Definitely should have checked the reviews before ordering."
"7/30/2018","1 star ","Do not order from this place. They took my credit card info and never delivered anything. When I called them they were full of excuses then eventually said that no one answered the door, which was total bull crap. This place will definitely rip you off. We went to my son's graduation from Air Force boot camp and this place takes advantage of out-of-towners."
"6/3/2017","1 star ","We ordered a gyro um not even close it had very little meat , sauce, and was more on pita bread or something of that sort. The pizza was horrible. The bottom was burnt and very little sauce on pizza plus there was pockets of air in pizza. It was definitely not worth the $32 we spent. Never again will we order from here."
"6/23/2018","1 star ","Wish I would have canceled after the horrible customer service. Stuck it out, pizza was cold, not good. Not sure how they are still in business."
"6/29/2018","1 star ","This should absolutely be zero stars. Took over an hour and a half for delivery. Pizza was cold, of course. And a $12.99 pizza ended up costing $24.80. Pizza didn't have much flavor and probably the worst part was the random chunks of onions (I hate onions and could smell them as soon as I opened the box). I will never order from here again."
"8/19/2017","1 star ","These guys hire kids to trespass downtown hotels and deliver flyers under doors instead of giving them to front desk staff to try their food and recommend their business. Our guest sometimes get sick from the food they ordered from 24th st Pizzeria and other businesses like them, the guest complaint to the hotel staff of food poisoning. We direct our guest to the San Antonio health department for complaints on this and other pizzeria restaurants who trespass our hotels. The Slice Pizzeria, Angelo's Pizzeria, Big Tony's Pizzeria, Chicago Pizzeria. Be aware of price change, delivery fees, Scammers. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD!"
"4/19/2017","1 star ","The. Worst. Customer service.Delivering pizza is not rocket science. But since this isn't my first time ordering food delivery, I understand that places get busy, people make mistakes, etc... when restaurants don't acknowledge they've given BAD service, for whatever reason, or at least try to make it better? They deserve to go out of business, and most likely will eventually. I just hope that the management here moves into an industry other than food service because clearly they don't understand the concept of CUSTOMER SERVICE."
"10/28/2018","1 star ","Ok... I'm in town for an Airforce graduation and my hotel room had a menu slide under my door pretty much everyday. We decided to order pizza so I called this business and the female that asked the phone had a negative attitude and seemed like she totally hated her job. When my order was complete (paid w/ credit card) and asked for paper plates, napkins, crushed peppers, and parmesan because it's take out.... then the negative female says they charge for these items.... I said really... but we are staying in a hotel room and need plates & napkins to eat... she said yes they charge for all togo items, so I said please cancel my order I will call another Pizza restaurant for take out. I let the hotel know about my experience and they apologized, then recommended 2 other local pizza joints. I should have checked yelp because it looks like every yelp post is a 1 Star negative experience! My first negative Dining experience in San Antonio ever! DO NOT waste your time with this place!  They ran my credit card anyway!!"
"4/2/2018","1 star ","I ordered this through Uber Eats.  Pro:  did show up in about 30-40 minutes, as promised.  Cons:  Food.  I ordered a ham and turkey sandwich, was described as having mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes.  I asked to add onion.  It was burned pizza dough bread with ham, turkey, and raw onion (no mayo, lettuce, tomatoes).  Also ordered a pizza with veggies.  Somehow, the pizza dough was burned/black, but soggy in the middle, and the toppings were completely raw - including the tomatoes - which were halved cherry tomatoes thrown on top."

Complete waste of money, it was hilariously bad and the people answering the phones were rude."

"8/6/2018","1 star ","Terrible service and delivery. Continuously hung up on when asking where our order was after an hour and a half. Food was cold when it finally showed up over 2 hours after ordering. Never again, I'd put 0 stars if possible. My suggestion to them is to shut down."
"5/26/2018","1 star ","Horrible food, terrible customer service and dishonest staff. Tried to sneak in extra charges and could not add 4 numbers together. Please do not order from here or trust any of their food (especially if you have little ones)."
"6/11/2017","1 star ","Wish I had checked the reviews! Ordered delivery through GrubHub to our hotel, which had a flier for restaurant in room. Pizza/wing combo, plain spaghetti for child, total with tip of $38. Order took nearly 2 hours, arrived cold, missing wings and with spaghetti slathered in sauce and meatballs. Pizza (pepperoni/mushrooms) wasn't as good as most frozen varieties, sugary sauce and sparse toppings. Order-taker said she would have to ""call manager"" to see if he wanted to send out missing wings and correct spaghetti, and they didn't do refunds. She didn't call me back. GrubHub got them to promise to send new food, but it never came and order-taker hung up when I phoned back. Avoid this place like the plague. (Fortunately GrubHub made good on what I had paid.)"
"3/31/2017","1 star ","I ordered pizza delivery and it took 2 hours to arrive and they didn't even apologize for it.  I'd ordered extra-large and got a large.  And the pizza itself was mediocre -- limp doughy slices that fell apart, not crispy or crunchy at all."
"8/26/2018","1 star ","Horrible customer service to start off. Lady taking my order was very rude and rushed me off the phone. I had never ate there and was trying to get ideas of what to get to feed a big group. I ended up ordering 2lg pizza, 16wings, and mozzarella sticks. Pizzas were cold and had flour all over the pizza. Wings had ranch spilled ALL over them, the containers were open inside the box. Mozzarella sticks were cold and soggy. I called back and asked to talk to a manager and the lady said there wasn't one there. Very disappointing seeing as we rarely go to SA and got poor quality food for the money we spent. They don't even deserve 1 star."
"8/5/2018","1 star ","Ordered a pizza and a Coke, took them 1 hour and 45 minutes to deliver on a Sunday night. The pizza was cold. We called them back to complained and they hung up on us the first the the second call they just pushed to voice mail."
"7/29/2018","1 star ","Trash trash trash. Worst restaurant ever. Please close this place down. The food is poison and the staff is extremely disrespectful. I do not understand how this establishment is still in business."
"7/28/2018","1 star ","They over charged by over $20. The order was wrong. I only got 15 wings instead of 24, both deserts were wrong, I ordered the pizza thin crust, after delivery when I called they said they don't do thin crust. The girl on the phone just argued with me and didn't admit they made a mistake and offered no solution. I guess now I have to call my credit card and dispute the charges. One star is way to many."
"6/6/2017","1 star ","When I called I was told one hour ten minutes.  After one hour ten minutes no pizza.  I called they said it was leaving in fifteen minutes.  Arrived one hour thirty minutes.  Driver didn't have plates forks or napkins as I was staying in a hotel this would have been very helpful.  Called the business the girl who answered could care less about our complaint.  If I could give zero stars I would."
"1/19/2017","1 star ","Took 2 hours for them to deliver our pizza when we were quoted on an hour. Food was lukewarm and you could tell the pizza had been sitting for a while, and was not very good either. My boyfriend ordered the Alfredo and said it was disgusting. After a long day of traveling from Iowa and waiting for our food for two hours he did not even finish it. Crappy food for a long long wait. Listen to the yelp reviews and take your business elsewhere."
"10/21/2018","1 star ","horrible pizza, half of it was stuck to the box, it was delivered cold. They put fliers under the door at the Holiday Inn and took an hour to deliver. the worst pizza I have ever had in my life! Thought it might be good because they slid a menu under my door at the hotel, HORRIBLE!  I am going to talk with the hotel management and tell them never to let them put menus under the door because they will drag the hotels reputation down"
"10/4/2017","1 star ","Rude Rude Rude--I used Ubereats I did not get my Salad I ordered Strawberry Cheesecake they gave me Chocolate I called I spoke with MIKE supposedly he's in charge refusing to give me a refund let alone ask me my name! I will call back tomorrow if I get no where I will file in small claims court for mainly the principle then I will ask for wages lost to attend court I work in Surgery all because MIKE refused to help me"
"6/22/2018","1 star ","Order at your own risk. Horrible, horrible, horrible. If I could put negative 10 I would. Took over an hour to deliver. When I called to ask for an ETA, the lady who answered sounded like she was drunk. The driver was nice but the food was horrible. Made all of us sick. Please be smarter than me and check yelp before you order."
"6/3/2018","1 star ","This place is horrible it took over an hour for our delivery and food was gross and undercooked!! Wouldn't eat it, even if I was going to the chair!!!!"
"5/18/2018","1 star ","Should have read reviews. Paid for a 3 topping pizza and a soda. Got the soda and a 1 topping pizza. Called to ask them to send me the correct pizza that I paid for, and never got it.  Called the next night, waited for two hours for them to bring the pizza and never got it. Called to ask where it was and they claim they didn't know what I was talking about. Never again."
"5/18/2018","1 star ","I ordered a pizza and after 3 hours my food was cold and the driver acted like it was my fault.  I rejected the pizza and called 24th Street Pizzeria back to get a refund. No refund was issued. The workers were very rude and disrespectful with me. This is the worse customer service I've ever encountered.  I will report this restaurant to the Better Business Bureau very soon.  I would strongly consider spending money elsewhere."
"5/3/2018","1 star ","The worker who answered my phone call was rude. Called to place an order for delivery & she said the wait was an hour & a half (ok I understand that, they are probably busy) so we decided to order & im starting to tell her what I want, I haven't even said the first 3 words & she interrupts me saying she needs my address first... ok whatever I give her the address & I have to repeat it at least 3 times. So I tell her what I want & get a wing combo with fries she says there's no fries so I pause for a second expecting her to say ""well I can substitute the fries with...."" the silence begins to become awkward & i decide to ask ""well is there anyway I can substitute the fries with some mozzarella sticks?"" & she says ""no"" that's it, nothing else. I understand if you guys can't substitute but at least say something along the lines of ""oh sorry unfortunately I can not substitute"" I ended up just hanging up on her & we got something else to eat."
"5/3/2018","1 star ","Never order pizza from this place. If I could give 0 stars I would. They messed up my order which was an honest mistake but their response to my request for a new pizza was beyond unprofessional. The young women taking my order was rude, argumentative, and lacked anything resembling customer service skills. When I finally just asked for a refund they told me they couldn't give one because the manager wasn't there until tomorrow. The women also refused to give me her name and only knew her manager as ""Mike"". I called the next day to speak with the manager and kept getting a voice mail that was full."
"12/17/2017","1 star ","We stayed at the Hotel Valencia & received a flyer for pizza delivery until 3am. We called at 2am to order pizza delivered to the hotel & the rude girl with no customer service & abruptly told us they were closed & hung up on us. If you were closed why answer the phone???"
"6/3/2018","1 star ","Found a flyer in my hotel.  Called and placed an order.  They said would take about an hour.  Hour and a half later I called to find out status of order.  Female answered, said was on the way and hung up on me.  I called back, male answered, I advised of female's rude service and hanging up on me, he said ok and placed me on hold, then line hung up.  Food arrived after two hours.  Spaghetti tasted like it came out of a can, and pizza was garbage.  ***Do not order food from this restaurant.  RUDE service and HORRIBLE food."
"5/22/2018","1 star ","Terrible service.  Promised to deliver to our hotel within one hour.  Took an hour & 1/2. Pizza was cold. We told the delivery person that we were supposed to receive it 30 minutes earlier. He stated: ""don't always believe what you hear!"""
"1/16/2018","1 star ","Ordered pizza. After two hours no pizza, I called and canceled.  Never received pizza but still charged credit card.  Have called credit card company to have taken off.  Would give zero if I could."
"12/16/2017","1 star ","Ordered for delivery. All wrong. Forgot plates we ordered. Forgot 2 liter coke we ordered. Got the wrong dessert. Under cooked pizza. An hr and a half plus wait time for delivery. Cold food. Called to ask for order to be corrected or at least speak to a manager. Was informed that managers do not work on weekends and manager would not be informed until Monday. (Ordered on a Saturday evening) Bad service, horrible food cold food. Stayed at the Embassy suites. Do not order from this place they will not fix your order if it is wrong. They will not offer even and apology in the least."
"5/28/2017","5 star ","The pizza is really delicious and the owner is very kind and is the best pizza specialty shop. The meat ball spaghetti is also really delicious."
"11/26/2017","1 star ","This place is the worst I have ever visited in my life. My girlfriend and I were at sharton hotel, she found flyer around our room's doorway; she ordered pizza from this place. We got wrong order (very cold as well); we called their number again to let them know that, we got a wrong order and requested them to just give us crushed pepper ( which was in order when she placed the order). I admit we called the phone several times after each eta and we had been told that they will deliver it in 10 mins. We waited over 30 to 40 mins, nobody shows up; called again and lady at the pizzare told us that we shouldn't be calling personal number but that was the number they were using to take the orders. So we went in person to store ( another mistake in series). Those were the bunch of criminals we were dealing with, they started speaking very loud, cursing, menacing and speaking racis words toward  us and denied to give us correct order. We still stand our ground and asked to give us our order. They did when another customer that also there who witnessed the abuse interven in our favor but they were very abusive while doing so. In fact very very abusive. I feel pity for those people (like us) who order the food from these criminals, without knowing and reading reviews. In addition to this, the guy told us reviews doesn't affect him. We told our hotel, not to allow these kind of business run buy  criminals to float their leaflet in hotel rooms"
"10/20/2017","1 star ","This is the first and the last time I will order from this place! I should've read the reviews before!!! What a mistake!! Horrible food, missing toppings and extra toppings that I did not order on my pizza. I called to make a complaint, and the person on the phone asked me: What? Are you kidding me???"
"12/16/2017","1 star ","Ordered food for delivery, the lady made me repeat myself multiple times because she didn't understand what i was ordering and seemed irritated that i called. Got my food an hour later, paid $40 for 8 wings, pickle chips, and 2 pieces of cheesecake. They brought the wrong flavors of cheesecake and the wrong flavor of wings. Food was not good."
"10/2/2017","1 star ","Absolutely disgusting! Burnt! Chicken alfredo had no flavor or the chicken burnt hamburger bun for bread. Don't waste your time"
"4/15/2017","1 star ","Ordered a pizza that was supposed to be $23.99, when the order arrived an hour an a half later (they said 45 minutes or less) they had charged me $35. No detailed receipt or explanation. When I called back I was put on hold for nearly 10 minutes and then hung up on. Crappy food and worse business practices."
"4/15/2017","1 star ","DO NOT ORDER!!! It's a scam. They aren't supposed to be coming in to the hotels and put their menus under the door. We've been told by the hotel manager to call the cops when we see them. So that's exactly what I'm going to do. The delivery guy has to be some sort of criminal because he threatened me. Over some pizza... the manager is a piece of work too. Said good luck on getting your money back after the order was 2hrs late, 10dollars over charged AND the wrong order."
"6/22/2018","1 star ","TRAVELERS BEWARE!!! They advertised in the hotel I am staying in and I thought it would make for an easy night staying in. The calzone I ordered came as a meal deal with fries and a 12oz drink for $8.99 the driver shows up leaves my receipt in his car and shows me a cost of $18.xx hands me my food and leaves. I call them back to have the driver bring me my receipt, as this is a business trip and I have to account for all costs, they said they would send him right out, but two hours later I still haven't received it. When I called back to check on things I asked about the additional cost and the girl who answered the phone was very rude to me. I started to get angry about this (though i never yelled) she hang up on me. I feel lied to, I feel like I've been stolen from, and all this over a nasty burned calzone, under cooked greasy fries, and a warm can of Coke. Do not order from this place. Ever!"
"6/5/2018","1 star ","ordered threw uber eats not worth it chicken parm was just horrible. pizza had no flavor just disappointed"
"7/24/2017","1 star ","Why can I not give negative stars.  We placed an order at 11:30pm.  At 12:45 we called to see where the pizza was.  Were told it was on the way.  at 1:00am when we called they didn't know where the driver was they would not answer their phone or text.  at 1:30am they still did not know where our pizza was then they told us it was about 5 mins away.  And asked if we wanted to cancel order.  We told them no they had already charged our card and they were not willing to credit it.  Then 10 mins later it still was not there we called again they told us we canceled the order and the driver was headed back to the store.  We told them we had not and they were very rude.  They called the driver to come back.  We finally got our pizza about 2:15am.  If the driver did not have our pizzas in her hand we may have thought she was a prostitute.  She was not dressed appropriately to be going to strange peoples doors.  Oh and I almost forgot the free 2 liter of coke we were supposed to get did not make it there either.  The pizza was cold.  DON'T ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
